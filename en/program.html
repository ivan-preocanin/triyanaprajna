  Course of Studies
</h1>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies begin with the basic principles of Dharma and gradually open to more daring areas of
  knowledge and practice. During the course of studies students will have the chance to learn from the twenty-five
  hundred year long tradition of Buddhadharma in its most prominent forms: from <i>sūtras</i> (Buddha's talks and
  instructions) and <i>śāstras</i> (commentaries by masters of classical schools of Dharma) to <i>upadeśas</i>
  (practice
  instructions). The study materials consist of traditional Dharma texts by classical and modern Dharma masters, with a
  few chosen works of the Western interpreters of Buddhism.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school, just as Buddha's teaching, begins with studying the Four Noble Truths, the Four
  Foundations of Mindfulness, and other primary subjects in the first semester. In the second semester students will
  engage the Abhidharma materials and their practical applications.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second year introduces the study and practice of the path of the bodhisattva, relative
  and absolute bodhicitta, and the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras during the third semester. The fourth semester is dedicated to
  the study of Madhyamaka as a conceptual expression of the Middle Way.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the third year, the main topic of study is the meaning of the Third Turning of the
  Wheel of Dharma sūtras, Yogācāra tradition, and the concept of Buddha Nature as an introduction into great openness,
  beyond all conceptualizations. The focal point in the sixth semester is Vajrayāna systems of practice.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program is designed in such a way that each step includes and deepens previously acquired
  understanding. This systematic and practical approach is inspired by the program of Buddhist Studies at Naropa
  University, which in turn is based on the tradition of Buddhist education in the great monastic universities of India
  and Tibet.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the school starts at a level which does not require any particular prior knowledge,
  by the second semester students will encounter materials at the graduate level commensurate with the courses in
  classical monastic institutions. This seemingly demanding program should not discourage anyone since the main goal is
  to increase a sense of personal understanding, and not intellectual achievement. Dharma education requires curiosity,
  inspiration, and commitment to personal growth through studies, not some special intellectual abilities.
</p>
<h4>
  Contemplative approach
</h4>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main point of Dharma studies is not just to acquire knowledge, but to apply the knowledge
  in working with one's own mind. Intellectual understanding is approached from the practical standpoint: not as a
  philosophy or consecrated religious tradition, but as a set of tools that helps to transform personal experience.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The double-edged sword of prajñā or discriminative awareness which develops during the
  educational process, cuts through our conceptual mishmash with one side, and afflicted emotions in the root of our
  confusion with the other. Critical intelligence is used to simultaneously examine both the reading materials and the
  reader's own views.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of learning should not be sense of intellectual achievement, but of personal
  growth and awareness. In short, infusing the knowledge of Dharma into one's life can only bring us closer to the
  complete and comprehensive sense of no-knowledge.
</p>
<h4>
  Meditation
</h4>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without commitment to daily meditation there is simply no basis to understand or communicate
  Dharma in the most helpful way. Therefore the necessary condition to attend the school is five hours of meditation
  per week, one three-day retreat per semester, and one seven-day retreat per year.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with <i>rimé</i> or the unbiased approach to Dharma it is said that Buddha gave
  84000
  different types of instructions for 84000 types of life troubles. Therefore practicing within any of the existing
  practice lineages is equally recognized as an expression of Buddha's teachings. Vipassana, Zen, Pure Land, or
  Vajrayāna practices are valid in fulfilling of this condition. Only knowledge rooted in such daily practice can bring
  a student closer to fulfilling one's own purpose.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every student will meet with a meditation instructor three times during the semester to
  discuss any questions or concerns regarding meditation practice. If a student does not have meditation instructions,
  one can receive them from qualified instructors within the school. If a student has difficulty in finding a place for
  the retreat, the place can be made available through the school without additional fees.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic condition to attend the school is not that students arrive as Buddhists or become
  Buddhists, but it is committed work on one's own mind trough the discipline of meditation.
</p>
<h4>
  Structure of the class and required readings
</h4>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every class has three parts: meditation, short introductory lecture, and group discussion of
  the reading materials which is the main part of the class. This format facilitates both focus and the friendly space
  necessary for students to express their views.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students are required to arrive well-prepared for every class. This takes not only reading,
  but understanding the materials to the best of one's ability. Every student should pick out parts of the texts she
  finds most interesting in some way, and share them as topics for discussion. A part of the discipline of studying is
  being ready to examine one's understanding or non-understanding in conversation with other students. Everybody is
  encouraged to share one's own discoveries. In short: <i>“In order to study and learn properly, we have to pull up our
  own socks.”</i> (Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche).
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students need a solid ability to read and understand English because most of the readings are
  in that language for the time being. All the books and materials for the classes will be provided through the school.
</p>
<h4>
  Attendance, final paper, and grades
</h4>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students need to make every effort to attend every class. If a person is sick or must miss
  the class, it is necessary that he reviews notes from classmates or arranges to record the class.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last class of every semester, students are required to submit an eight to ten page
  essay. An outline of the essay should be submitted at the penultimate class and discussed with the instructor. The
  topic of the essay is based on readings which inspired a student during the semester.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students will receive descriptive grades in each semester as guidance for further studies.
  This also provides the teacher with an opportunity to express his gratitude for their dedicated work.
</p>
<h4>
  Enrollment and costs
</h4>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program starts at the end of February 2019 and continues for three years divided into
  spring and fall semesters. Each semester has twelve weeks with one class per week. The classes are three hours long
  and take place on Sundays.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A potential student who wants to enroll in the Triyāna Prajñā School of Dharma, first needs
  to write a short essay about oneself and one's motives to attend this school. Detailed biographies or CVs with a list
  of achievements are not required. The essay should contain a few words about how you feel about your current life,
  how you encountered the Dharma, what you would most like to learn in the school, and how you think to persist in the
  three-year long program. The essay should offer a frank assessment of your qualities and aspirations.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essays should be mailed to <a class="email" href="mailto:triyanaprajna@gmail.com">triyanaprajna@gmail.com</a>.
  by February 21st, 2019. Enrollment is limited due to the need to keep the discussion group small so that everyone
  will have time to express their viewpoints.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuition is 108 Euros per semester to be paid before the first class. A few scholarships are
  available based on need and merit. If you want to apply for a scholarship, please write a separate essay concerning
  that topic, and we will reply to your request.
